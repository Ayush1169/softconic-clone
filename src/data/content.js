The institute required a robust digital solution to enhance their existing system by incorporating an online Learning Management System (LMS) to cater to students, parents, and administrators while offering seamless integration with their existing hostel, inventory, and CRM systems. The goal was to provide a white-label solution that could streamline operations and create a centralized platform for learning, accommodation, resource management, and customer relationship management.",
    "overview": "MKC faced several challenges in implementing this comprehensive system. They required a white-label solution with limited customization due to cost constraints, necessitating a balance between flexibility and out-of-the-box functionality. The integration of hostel, inventory, and CRM systems posed technical challenges in ensuring smooth data flow. The platform needed to cater to three distinct user types (Students, Parents, and Administrators) with role-based access, while maintaining simplicity and feature breadth. Additionally, the system had to be highly scalable to handle thousands of concurrent users accessing various features without performance lags.",
