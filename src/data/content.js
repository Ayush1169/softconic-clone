The institute required a robust digital solution to enhance their existing system by incorporating an online Learning Management System (LMS) to cater to students, parents, and administrators while offering seamless integration with their existing hostel, inventory, and CRM systems. The goal was to provide a white-label solution that could streamline operations and create a centralized platform for learning, accommodation, resource management, and customer relationship management.",

They required a white-label solution with limited customization due to cost constraints, necessitating a balance between flexibility and out-of-the-box functionality.
